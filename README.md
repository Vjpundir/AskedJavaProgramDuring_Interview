HI Everyone , 

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that were asked during my SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) automation interview process.

I'm currently pushing these programs one by one as I organize and update them. You'll also find some commonly asked Java coding problems that frequently come up in interviews.

Thanks 
Vijay Pundir
